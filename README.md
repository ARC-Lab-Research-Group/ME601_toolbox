# ME601 Toolbox
This repository is used in the instruction of ME601: Introduction to Feedback
Control of Autonomous Systems at the [University of
Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). The toolbox includes a quadcopter
simulator (adapted from
[here](https://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~meam620/wiki/index.php)) and relevant
example code. This toolbox also includes code to generate minimum-snap
trajectories in flat output space. The toolbox can also be used alongside the
private ROS package `arclab_quadcopters` to implement the algorithms in real
hardware.
